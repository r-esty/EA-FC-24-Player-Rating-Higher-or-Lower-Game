About the project:
This is a small project which I had made in Python which I had help learnt about different ways of recieving player statisitics into Python such as using webscraping/APIs and pandas however for this project I had used pandas due to being more efficent then the other methods I had tried, due to being quite interested in playing EA FC 24 I had decided to make a higher game in which users would be asked to decide which players has a higher overall rating on their gold standard card in EA FC 2 by pressing "A/b" or "B/b" on their keyboard.The user will either be allocated 3 points for correctly deciding the player with the higher rating therefore being to continue playing there streak or 1 point for a picking a player with the same rating still allowing the user to continue playing.However if the user decides incorrectly the user will lose the round they are on prompting the user the amount of points they had recieved from correct answers and wether the user would want to continue playing.
